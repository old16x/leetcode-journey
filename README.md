| [Merge Sorted Array](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/mergeSortedArray.go) | Easy       | Array, Sorting    | Merged two sorted arrays by appending elements from nums2 into nums1, and then sorted nums1 in ascending order\.                                                      |
| [Remove Element](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeElement.go)     | Easy       | Array             | Removed all occurrences of the value 'val' from the 'nums' array by shifting non-matching elements to the front, and returned the length of the resulting array\.    |
| [Two Sum](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/twoSum.go)            | Easy       | Array, Hash Table | Utilized a hash table to efficiently find the indices of two numbers in the nums array that sum up to the target value. Iterated through the array, stored the complement of each number encountered in the hash table. If a complement was found later, returned the corresponding indices as an array\. |
| [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeDuplicatesFromSortedArray.go)            | Easy       | Array | Used a pointer k to track the current position for unique elements. Compared each element with its previous element, and if a new unique element was found, it was assigned to nums[k] and k was incremented. Returned k as the resulting array length\. |
| [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeDuplicatesFromSortedArrayII.go)        | Medium       | Array | Initialized a pointer k to track the current position for the unique elements. Iterated through the array starting from index 2, comparing each element with the element at nums[k-2]. If a new unique element was found, it was assigned to nums[k] and k was incremented. Finally, returned k as the length of the array without duplicates\. |
| [Majority Element](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/majorityElement.go)        | Easy       | Array, Hash Table | Identified the majority element in the nums array, which is the element that appears more than len(nums)/2 times. Utilized a hash table to count the occurrences of each element in the array. If the count of a particular element exceeds len(nums)/2, returned that element as the majority element. If no majority element was found, returned -1\. |
| [Rotate Array](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/rotateArray.go)        | Medium       | Array | Rotated the elements in the nums array to the right by k steps. First, calculated the effective rotation amount by taking k modulo len(nums). Then, created a temporary slice tmp by appending the last n-k elements of nums with the first k elements of nums. Finally, copied the elements from tmp back to nums to perform the rotation\. |
| [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/bestTimeToBuyAndSellStock.go)        | Easy       | Array | Determined the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock from the prices array. Initialized a variable buy with the first price in the array. Iterated through the array starting from index 1. If the current price is lower than buy, updated buy with the current price. Otherwise, if the difference between the current price and buy is greater than maxProfit, updated maxProfit with that difference. Finally, returned maxProfit as the maximum achievable profit\. |
| [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/bestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII.go)        | Medium       | Array | Calculated the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks from the prices array multiple times. Initialized buy with the first price as the buying price. Iterated through the array, and if a price higher than buy was encountered, added the difference between the current price and buy to maxProfit. Updated buy to the current price at each step. Finally, returned maxProfit as the maximum achievable profit\. |
