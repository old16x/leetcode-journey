| [Merge Sorted Array](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/mergeSortedArray.go) | Easy       | Array, Sorting    | Merged two sorted arrays by appending elements from nums2 into nums1, and then sorted nums1 in ascending order\.                                                      |
| [Remove Element](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeElement.go)     | Easy       | Array             | Removed all occurrences of the value 'val' from the 'nums' array by shifting non-matching elements to the front, and returned the length of the resulting array\.    |
| [Two Sum](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/twoSum.go)            | Easy       | Array, Hash Table | Utilized a hash table to efficiently find the indices of two numbers in the nums array that sum up to the target value. Iterated through the array, stored the complement of each number encountered in the hash table. If a complement was found later, returned the corresponding indices as an array\. |
| [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeDuplicatesFromSortedArray.go)            | Easy       | Array | Used a pointer k to track the current position for unique elements. Compared each element with its previous element, and if a new unique element was found, it was assigned to nums[k] and k was incremented. Returned k as the resulting array length\. |
| [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://github.com/rad16x/leetcode-journey/blob/main/removeDuplicatesFromSortedArrayII.go)        | Medium       | Array | Initialized a pointer k to track the current position for the unique elements. Iterated through the array starting from index 2, comparing each element with the element at nums[k-2]. If a new unique element was found, it was assigned to nums[k] and k was incremented. Finally, returned k as the length of the array without duplicates\. |
